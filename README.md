OBJECTIVE  -  
The Hotel aimed to create a customer Analytics report to gain insights into their overall Net Promoter Scores (NPS). Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a management tool that can be used by a Hotel, a Restaurant, or a Company to gauge loyalty in customer relationships. The customer gives the company a recommendation score between 0-10 based on one's experience. Values between 0-6 are considered detractors, values between 7-8 as passives, and values between 9-10 as promoters.
